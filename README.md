# mci_emotion: R Scripts for EEG Data Analysis

Hosts code for data analysis for an EEG language comprehension experiment with two experimental factors: semantics (semantically intuitive vs. semantic violation vs. minimally counterintuitive) Ã— context emotionality (emotionally neutral vs. negative). All code is written in [R](https://www.r-project.org) using the [eeguana](https://github.com/bnicenboim/eeguana) package.

[Scripts](https://github.com/alexenge/mci_emotion/tree/master/scripts) contains the raw R scripts; [output](https://github.com/alexenge/mci_emotion/tree/master/output) contains rendered PDF reports of the scripts including the R output.
